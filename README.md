Title: Is news a downer?

Author: Mengfan Cheng

Content:

This repository is about testing the hypothesis that hard news is about bad news. 6000 tweets were collected from the twitter accounts of 10 serious media including New York Times, NPR, CNN, Wall Street Journal, AFP, Guardian, Reuters, New Yorker, Associated Press and Financial Times. Each word of the tweets are analyzed and assigned with "positive", "negative" or "neutral". The credit of sentiment coding to given to Dr. Pablo Barbera. 

The codes are in the file "script.R". Detailed analysis and data visualization is in "Output_Interpretation.docx". This is the first time I've ever completed a data scraping and analysis project with R. If there is any question, please let me know.
